# CopyFullPathToClipboard

This application lets you to add on the context menu of your Windows
a new option called "Copy path to clipboard" for files and folders.

Clicking on it you get the absolute full path of that file or folder
in your clipboard. So, you can get that information just pasting as
usual.

There are two projects in this code:
- Installer, which are the installer config files from InstallShield
  It is in this process where the register of your Windows
  is modified to call to the app which really makes the work.
- SetClipboard, it is a very simple app which only copies into
  the clipboard all the arguments that it has.
  
As you can understand, this is only a minimum application to get
started working with GitHub.

Thanks for reading this.

Feel free to download this and comment everything you need.
