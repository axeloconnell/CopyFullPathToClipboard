# CopyFullPathToClipboard

This application lets you to add on the context menu of your Windows
a new option called "Copy path to clipboard" for files and folders.

Clicking on it you get the absolute full path of that file or folder
in your clipboard. So, you can get that information just pasting as
usual.

There is a project called: SetClipboard which actually is a very
simple app which only copies into the clipboard all the arguments
that it has.
  
As you can understand, this is only a minimum application to get
started working with GitHub.

Thanks for reading this.

Feel free to download this and comment everything you need.
